<br>
<h2>USE OF COPYRIGHT MATERIAL AND PROOF OF OWNERSHIP OF CONTENT<br></h2>
<br>
Sites must not contain Warez, copyright or other illegal material
including links or redirects to copyright material hosted on 3rd party
websites / resources. The onus is on you the customer to prove that you
own the rights to publish material, not for Securesignup&nbsp; to prove
that you do not.&nbsp; Securesignup&nbsp; does not allow the
propagation or distribution of copyright material, files or warez under
any circumstances.<br>
<br>
<h2>ACCEPTABLE SERVER RESOURCE USE<br></h2>
<br>
Sites must not use excessive amounts of server resources. These include
bandwidth, processor utilization and / or disk space. Please see the
'High Resource Use Policy' in the General Terms and Conditions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h2>SCRIPT USAGE TERMS<br></h2>
<br>
Scripts on the site must be designed to produce web-based content, and
not to use the server as an application server. Using the server to
generate large volumes of email from a database is an example of
activity that is not allowed. Scripts should not attempt to manipulate
the timeouts on servers. These are set at the present values to ensure
the reliability of the server. Sites that reset these do so because
they are resource intensive, and adversely affect server performance
and are therefore not allowed. Scripts that are designed to provide
proxy services, anonymous or otherwise, are not allowed.<br>
<br>
The primary purpose of any script must be to produce a web page.
Scripts that send a single email based upon user entered information,
or update a database are acceptable. Scripts that send bulk email or
perform processor intensive database processes are not allowed. All
outgoing mail is monitored and filtered and must be sent to or from a
Securesignup -hosted domain.<br>
<br>
Sites must not contain scripts that attempt to access privileged server
resources, or other sites on the same server<br>
USAGE OF DISK SPACE TERMS<br>
<br>
Securesignup&nbsp; offers large web space and bandwidth with hosting
accounts. By this, we mean space for legitimate web site content and
bandwidth for visitors to view it. All files on a domain must be part
of the active website and linked to the site. Sites should not contain
any backups, downloads, or other non-web based content. We will treat
all password protected archive (e.g. zip and rar) files as
unacceptable. Multimedia content such as audio and video is acceptable
provided it is streamed to the user, links to HTTP download of this
content is not acceptable.<br>
<br>
<h2>INODE USAGE<br></h2>
<br>
In computing, an inode is a data structure on a traditional Unix-style
file system such as UFS. An inode stores basic information about a
regular file, directory, or other file system object.<br>
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inode<br>
<br>
Securesignup&nbsp; reserves the right to limit INODEs usage on premium
hosting plans to 180,000 and unlimited inodes on Business hosting plans
subject to acceptable usage.<br>
<br>
<h2>Right to suspend / terminate hosting services<br></h2>
<br>
We reserve the right to suspend or terminate any hosting services if a
website/hosting service consumes excessive server resources or effects
other websites / hosting services on a shared or clustered hosting
server. Excessive resource usage can constitute any form of server
usage calculated and determined at the discretion of Securesignup .
Securesignup&nbsp; reserves the right to suspend service at any time
without prior notice if or when the health or normal running /
performance of a service is effected / degraded by a website or hosting
service.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
You acknowledge that Securesignup&nbsp; may or may not pre-screen
Content, but that Securesignup&nbsp; and its designees shall have the
right (but not the obligation) in their sole discretion to pre-screen,
refuse, or remove any Content that is available via the Service.
Without limiting the foregoing, Securesignup&nbsp; and its designees
shall have the right to remove any Content that violates the TOS or is
otherwise objectionable. You agree that you must evaluate, and bear all
risks associated with, the use of any Content, including any reliance
on the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of such Content. In this
regard, you acknowledge that you may not rely on any Content created by
Securesignup&nbsp; or submitted to Securesignup , including without
limitation information in Securesignup&nbsp; Message Boards and in all
other parts of the Service.<br>
<br>
You acknowledge, consent and agree that Securesignup&nbsp; may access,
preserve and disclose your account information and Content if required
to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access preservation
or disclosure is reasonably necessary to:<br>
<br>
(a) comply with legal process;<br>
<br>
(b) enforce the TOS;<br>
<br>
(c) respond to claims that any Content violates the rights of third
parties;<br>
<br>
(d) respond to your requests for customer service; or (e) protect the
rights, property or personal safety of Securesignup , its users and the
public.<br>
<br>
You understand that the technical processing and transmission of the
Service, including your Content, may involve<br>
<br>
(a) transmissions over various networks; and<br>
<br>
(b) changes to conform and adapt to technical requirements of
connecting networks or devices.<br>
<br>
You understand that the Service and software embodied within the
Service may include security components that permit digital materials
to be protected, and that use of these materials is subject to usage
rules set by Securesignup&nbsp; and/or content providers who provide
content to the Service. You may not attempt to override or circumvent

<h2>7. INTERSTATE NATURE OF COMMUNICATIONS ON Securesignup&nbsp; NETWORK<br></h2>
<br>
When you register with Securesignup , you acknowledge that in using
Securesignup&nbsp; services to send electronic communications

other Internet activities), you will be causing communications to be
sent through Securesignup 's computer networks, portions of which are
located in California, Ohio, UK, and other locations in the United
States and portions of which are located abroad. As a result, and also
as a result of Securesignup 's network architecture and business
practices and the nature of electronic communications, even
communications that seem to be intrastate in nature can result in the
transmission of interstate communications regardless of where you are
physically located at the time of transmission. Accordingly, by
agreeing to this Terms of Service, you acknowledge that use of the
service results in interstate data transmissions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h2>8. SPECIAL ADMONITIONS FOR INTERNATIONAL USE<br></h2>
<br>
Recognizing the global nature of the Internet, you agree to comply with
all local rules regarding online conduct and acceptable Content.

the transmission of technical data exported from the United States or
the country in which you reside.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
